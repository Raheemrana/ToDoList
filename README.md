# ToDoList
It is actually a To Do app that keeps the record of your daily tasks
It uses React on the Front End and
Nodes JS (Express JS) along SQLite3 database on the backend

It does all the required things as asked in the assignment and also 
follows the given UI but I missed doing 2 things 1- delete task 2- edit task
Other than this I have given time on authentication from both sides and the smooth
working of showing and creating new tasks.

To run this code:
- Clone the git
- Get to the terminal of Frontend folder and do 'npm install'
- To run Frontend run 'npm start' command on terminal
- Get to the terminal of Backend folder and do 'npm i express'
- To run Backend run 'npm run dev' command on terminal

This would pretty much work for this.

phew I know I have made typo in Frontend folder name
